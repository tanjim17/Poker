# Poker
It's a LAN multiplayer poker game built with JavaFX.

The game contains two poker tables, each consisting of 5 seats. So, at most 10 users can play at a time. Others have to wait until
any seat goes vacant (i.e any in-game player logs out). However, the initial capacity of a table (i.e when the server starts) is
set to 2 instead of 5. After the end of the first game, the capacity becomes 5 and remains so.

You need to create a user account to play the game. The accounts are password-protected. Your chips are automatically saved when 
you log out.
